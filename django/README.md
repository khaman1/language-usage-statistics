I have finished the problem by using Django, Redis and basic HTML. I have tried some histogram charts but they didn't look good.

## How to run this code
- Install Python and requirement.txt in the root folder
- Install redis server and update the hostname and ip if needed (the default is localhost:6379)
- Run the code by the following command:
    python manage.py runserver
